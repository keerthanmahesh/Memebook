# Memebook
Memebook is an Android application capable of loading some of the best memes of the early 2010s, allowing the user to add a CUSTOM TEXT, and sharing it on their social media of choice.


## Brief
A Meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular
phenomenon or theme.
Some of memes from the past decade composed of images with IMPACT text overlays on top of it.

## Implementation
 - The freely available _Meme Maker_ API, https://mememaker.github.io/API/, is used to display the _memes_ in a clickable Recycler View.
